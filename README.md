## Simulation of GoFish, Texas Holdem, and Pinochle in One Program

In this project, I simulated three separate card games in one program. While **Texas Holdem** and **Pinochle** only simulate a single round of play (and obviously there is no way to bet), **GoFish** can be played in its entirety with an Uno, Holdem, or Pinochle Deck. Check the Makefile for the executable's name, and run just the executable's name to see instructions on how to play. Thank you!
